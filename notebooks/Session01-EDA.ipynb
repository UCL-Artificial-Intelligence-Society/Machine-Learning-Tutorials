    "To build and train machine learning model more efficiently, Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA for short, should precede the building the training model. This statistical approach was introduced by Professor John Tukey, also widely known for fast fourier transform (FFT). \n",
    "The main goal of EDA is to analyze the data sets to understand its main characteristics, often with visualization, summary table and statistics. The one thing to note is that the term of visualization should be differentiated with EDA as the former is mainly for final stage of analysis, communication of results, and the latter is conducted at the beginning of the task.\n",
